```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
In this frst piece of coursework you will work with the easySHARE data. For information on data and variables, see the [easySHARE data  guide](http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/pdf_documentation/easySHARE_Release_8.0.0_ReleaseGuide.pdf).



## Load data

Load the easySHARE data. For information on data and variables, see the [easySHARE data  guide](http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/pdf_documentation/easySHARE_Release_8.0.0_ReleaseGuide.pdf).

```{r easyshare}
load("easySHARE_rel8_0_0.rda")
dat<-easySHARE_rel8_0_0

```


Load packages:
  
```{r packs, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
library(countrycode)
```

```{r}
length(unique(dat$mergeid))
table(dat$wave,dat$int_year)
table(dat$country, dat$wave)

```
## Pre-processing 

Notice the missing values (missing codes are explained on pg. 6 of missing codes of the easySHARE guide):



First missings and coding of factors. Here is an example.

```{r pre-processing}


summary(dat$isced1997_r) # all negative values are missings.

dat$isced1997_r[dat$isced1997_r<0] <- NA


table(addNA(dat$isced1997_r))

dat$educ<- factor(dat$isced1997_r,labels=c("0 - none", "1 - Primary education ", "2 - Lower secondary education",
                          "3 - (Upper) secondary education",
                          "4 - Post-secondary non-tertiary education",
                          "5 - First stage of tertiary education","6 - Second stage of tertiary education","95: still in school", "96: other"))
table(addNA(dat$educ)) # should make labels shorter

```

Next need to pick 1 - 2 waves, and up to 4 countries.

Then look at summaries. e.g. boxplots, tables, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts,..
